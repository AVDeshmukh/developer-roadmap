# Running Flutter Code

Flutterâ€™s widget-based architecture is quite unique compared to traditional programming methodologies. Once you understand how it works, it becomes second nature.
The main.dart file is the primary file for our application, which will determine the different routes for the different views of the application
The home_screen.dart widget represents the initial view of our application, which also lays out the styling and content of the application bar and body of the view
The profile_screen.dart file contains our second view ProfileScreen, which displays the user profile information of the user using the app in the content of the widget body

##Creating flutter app:
