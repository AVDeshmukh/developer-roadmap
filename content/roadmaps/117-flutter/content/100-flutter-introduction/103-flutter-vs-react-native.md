#Flutter vs React Native

##Demand
At the time of this writing, React Native is slightly more popular than Flutter, thanks in part to React Native's association with the popular web framework React. React Native has also been around for longer, so its user base is larger.
As such, there is currently higher demand for React Native developers than for Flutter developers. However, that doesn't mean Flutter is unpopular; in fact, Flutter continues to gain popularity over time.

##Performance
It's hard to decide whether a Flutter or React Native app has better performance. It won't be the same for every app; there are many factors to consider, like the type of app, codebase, animations, transitions, app size, layout, data passing, end user's phone, and more.
Both Flutter and React Native are open source and free to use. Both are well-maintained - as you would expect, considering they're created by Google and Facebook
Both Flutter and React Native are continuing to improve their performance with their developer and community support. But as of now, Flutter slightly wins on performance.

##Developer ecosystem
Flutter developers tend to refer to the official documentation. However, React Native has several options; for one, the official documentation, or a different platform, the most popular being Expo.
Both Flutter and React Native have been used in popular commercial applications. Flutter was used to create the apps for Baidu, Groupon, and eBay, to name a few. Meanwhile, the apps for Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, and Discord were built with React Native.
